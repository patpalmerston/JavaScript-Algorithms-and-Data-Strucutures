-   Some Patterns
    -   Frequency Counter
    -   Multiple Pointers
    -   Sliding Window
    -   Divide and Conquer
    -   Dynamic Programming
    -   Greedy Algorithms
    -   Backtracking
    -   etc....


    # Frequency Counter
      - This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
        - This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings
        - use an object to collect values and their frequencies. Helpful when you have multiple inputs      and need to compare if they have similar values. looking for frequencies of common things         happening.


    # Multiple Pointers Pattern
      - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition

      -very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

    # Sliding Window
      - This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
      - Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
      - very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc

    # Divide and Conquer
      - This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
      - This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
