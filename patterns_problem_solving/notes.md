    # Frequency Counter
      - This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
        - This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings
        - use an object to collect values and their frequencies. Helpful when you have multiple inputs      and need to compare if they have similar values. looking for frequencies of common things         happening.
