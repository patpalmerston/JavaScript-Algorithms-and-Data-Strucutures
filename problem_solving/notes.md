# Problem Solving

    - 2 Categories
        - first is basic approach to the problem, steps to take
        - second specific blue print or archtypes / blue prints to help solve the problem

# what is an algorithm

    - process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
    - could be mathematical steps
    - foundation for being a successful problem solving developer
    - everything

# How do you Improve?

    - Devise a plan for solving problems
    - Master common problem solving patterns

# Problem Solving Strategies

    - Understand the problem
      - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
      - what are the inputs that go into the problem
      - what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
      - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to      solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the     problem. That's okay: it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
      - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
