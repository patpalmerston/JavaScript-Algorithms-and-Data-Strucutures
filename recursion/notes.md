# RECURSION

A function that calls it self

-   it is everywhere and we use it all the time
-   JSON.parse or stringify is a recursive function
-   document.getElementById and DOM traversal alogrithms
-   Object traversal
-   We will see it with more complex data structures
-   It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

# The Call Stack

-   It's a stack data structure - we'll talk about that later!
-   Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack
-   When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)

# Recursive Function Rules

-   Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!
-   BASE CASE
    -   The condition when the recursion ends
    -   This is the most important concept to understand
-   Different Input
    -   call function with data each time, has to change as it hits the stack, until it hits the base case.

# Common issues with recursion

-   No BASE CASE or BASE CASE is wrong
-   Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing!
-   Stack overflow!

# Helper Method Recursion

-   an example of a non functioning helper method
-   Helper is on outer function that is not recursive that calls an inner function that is recursive

    function outer(input) {
    let outerScopedVariable = []

    function helper(helperInput) {
    // modify the outerScopedVariable
    helper(helperInput--)
    }
    helper(input)
    return outerScopedVariable;
    }

# Pure Recursion

-   For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
-   Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings
-   To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator
