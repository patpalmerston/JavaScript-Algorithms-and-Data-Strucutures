--What is dynamic programing
-Using past Knowledge to make solving a future problem easier
-A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

      -Overlapping Subproblems
        -A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times

     -Optimal Substructure
        -A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
