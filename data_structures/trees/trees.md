# Binary Trees

--What is a Tree?--
-A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

--Lots of different applications--
-HTML DOM
-Network Routing
-Abstract Syntax trees
-Artificial Intelligence
-Folders in an Operation System
-Computer file systems

--Kinds of Trees-- (many types of trees, we will only focus on a few)
-Trees (no real rules on how many branches, how many nodes, how many leaves)
-Binary Trees (each node can have at most two children(binary))
-Binary Search Trees (special case of binary tree - at most two children per node - Sorted in a specific order)

-   all items less than the root is located to the left
-   all items greater than the root are located to the right
