/*
Pseudo Code for addVertex
  -Write a method called addVertex, which accepts a name of a vertex
  -It should add a key to the adjacency list with the name of the vertex and set its value to be an empty array

Pseudo Code for addEdge
  -This function should accept two vertices, we can call them vertex1 and vertex2
  -The function should find the adjacency list the key of vertex and push vertex2 to the array
  -The function should find in the adjacency list the key of vertex2 and push vertex1 to the array
  = Don't worry about handling errors/invalid vertices

Pseudo Code for removeEdge
  -This function should accept two vertices, we'll call them vertx1 and vertex2
  - The function should reassign the key of vertex1 to be an array that does not contain vertex2
  - The function should reassign the key of vertex2 to be an array that does not contain vertex1
  - Don't worry about handling errors/invalid vertices
