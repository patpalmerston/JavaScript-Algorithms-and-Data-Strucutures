/*
INSERTION SORT

Insertion Sort Pseudocode
  
  -Start by picking the second element in the array
  -Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary.
  -Continue o the next element and if it si in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e.the left side) to place the element in the correct place
  -Repeat until the array is sorted
