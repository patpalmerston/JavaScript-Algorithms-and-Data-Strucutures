/*
DIJKSTRA pseudo code -

-This function should accept a starting and ending vertex
-Create an object (we'll call it distances) and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of infinity, except for the starting vertex which should have a value of 0.
-After setting a value in the distances object, add each vertex with a priority of infinity to the priority queue, except the starting vertex, which should have a priority of 0 because thats where we begin
-Create another object called previous and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of null
-Start looping as long as there is anything in the priority queue
  -dequeue a vertex from the priority queue
  -If that vertex is the same as the ending vertex - we are done!
  -Otherwise loop through each value in the adjacency list at that vertex
    -Calculate the distance to that vertex from the starting vertex
    -If the distance is less than what is currently stored in our distances object
        -update the distances object with new lower distance 
        -update the previous object to contain that vertex
        -enqueue the vertex with the total distance from the start node
